### Objectives:

- Extract the required data from the different file types(CSV, JSON, and XML file types)
- Transform data to the required format.
- Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS.

### Tasks:
- The height in the extracted data is in inches, and the weight is in pounds.  the height is required to be in meters, and the weight is required to be in kilograms, rounded to two decimal places.
- I need to load the transformed data to a CSV file that i can use to load to a database as per requirement.
