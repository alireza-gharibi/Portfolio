## Project Scenario
In this scenario, i'm a Linux developer at the top-tech company ABC International Inc. As one of ABC Inc.'s most trusted Linux developers, i have been tasked with creating a script called backup.sh which runs every day and automatically backs up any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.
The script accepts the absolute path to a directory as an argument in order to save the backup file within that directory.

The script should be scheduled using **cron** to run every 24 hours
